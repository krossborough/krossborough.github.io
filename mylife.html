<p> I grew up fifteen minutes from the beach in Kennebunk, Maine where I have lived my entire life. I have three younger siblings and was fortunate enough to be surrounded by a big family. I played several different sports when I was little, however I only stuck with dance which I did for fifteen years.</p>
