<p> I grew up fifteen minutes from the beach in Kennebunk, Maine where I have lived my entire life. I have three younger siblings, Phillip, Bella, and Brady. My parents, Edie and Robert, have always been my biggest supporters throughout life. I also have three golden retrievers and two cats, so my house can get pretty hectic sometimes. My favorite holiday is Christmas and my favorite color is blue. I danced for fifteen years and played several other sports when I was younger. I love watching hockey and baseball and I'm a die hard Boston fan. </p>
