<p>While I am currently pursuing a degree in Marketing, I would love to have a career in event planning. Since I work at a flower shop, I have seen some of the preparation that goes into planning events such as weddings, baby showers, and different parties and the excitement of seeing it all come together is something that I would love to experience for the rest of my life.</P>

<p>After graduation I hope to get a job in Boston and live there for a few years. I have always loved being in the city and I think that Boston would be a great place to get some experience in event planning before moving to a quieter area to spend the rest of my life. Eventually I want to have a house close to the beach and be in an area similar to what I grew up in.</p>
