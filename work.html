<p>My first job was bussing at a local diner in Wells where I worked for two years before I decided that I wanted to do something a little different. In May of 2017 I began working at Fleurant Flowers and Design, which is a flower/gift shop located in Lower Village, Kennebunk. I spent a lot of time in the shop, doing deliveries, and occasionally making flower arrangements and I really enjoyed the change in atmosphere from my first job. Among many things, this job has greatly enhanced my communication skills with people and has allowed me to handle a variety of different situations that I know will benefit me later in life.</p>
